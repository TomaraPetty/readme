## Description 
*Overview of this project:* 
* Expanding-cards is a website that I made for my wife to give her 8 reasons why I love her with an expanding card showcase. The cards are all photos stacked together. There is one active photo meaning that the full photo is visible. When you click on the inactive photos they become active and will show the full image. The page is dynamic and will shrink down for mobile users.
