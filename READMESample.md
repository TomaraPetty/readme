## Description 
*Overview of this project:* 
* Expanding-cards is a website that I made for my wife to give her 8 reasons why I love her with an expanding card showcase. The cards are all photos stacked together. There is one active photo meaning that the full photo is visible. When you click on the inactive photos they become active and will show the full image. The page is dynamic and will shrink down for mobile users.  

## Installation
*Steps required to install project and get the development environment established:*
* Make a clone of this repo into a new repo of your own. There is an html, css, js and images file so once you have that installed into your repo you can publish your site and it will function as shown in the usage section. 

## Usage
*Instructions and examples for use:* 
* The user may click through the images to reveal the text and image. When the user clicks to another image that image will become active and the text will appear. The previous image will become inactive and the text will disappear.
